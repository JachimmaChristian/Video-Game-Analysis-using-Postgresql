# Videogames-Analysis-using-Postgresql
In this project I explored the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020 using two datasets: ***game_sales*** and ***reviews***. The goal was to determine whether video games have improved as the gaming market has grown, comparing sales data with critic and user reviews.
